# Image-Character-Recognition
This project utilizes CNN in detecting and recognizing handwritten text images with a high accuracy. 
The CNN model is tested on English handwritten characters and 
validated on its performance. The model performs feature 
extraction from images through multiple layers. These are later 
used for training the model and thereby recognizing characters.

The dataset used in this Project is the Chars74K dataset of 
English language. A sample data in the dataset is shown below

The layers in the model are: Convolutional layer, Pooling 
layer, Dense or Fully Connected layer.

The model attained a high recognition accuracy of 97.59% 
with a loss of 6.6%. Real-time detection of characters is also 
implemented using contour based techniques.
