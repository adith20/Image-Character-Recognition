# Image-Character-Recognition
This project utilizes CNN in detecting and recognizing handwritten text images with a high accuracy. 
The CNN model is tested on English handwritten characters and 
validated on its performance. The model performs feature 
extraction from images through multiple layers. These are later 
used for training the model and thereby recognizing characters.
